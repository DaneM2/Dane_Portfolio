# [Project 1: Web-Traffic-Forecasting---Capstone](https://github.com/DaneM2/Web-Traffic-Forecasting---Capstone)
This project looks at the problem of forecasting future values of time-series data. Wikipedia has over 145,000 articles and their view counts available to analyze. Following the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process I was able to develop an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model that showed a prediction of view counts for the following 45 â€“ 60 days. Web forecasting is gaining popularity and has many applications including load balancing for cloud services, and understanding user behavior.

# [Project 2: Multiple-Regression-Project](https://github.com/DaneM2/Multiple-Regression-Project/tree/main)
## Sigma Coding Multiple Regression Project
Performed a multiple regression analysis on South Korea's GDP growth. South Korea in the 1950s came out of the Korean War, which left it's country ravaged and in extreme poverty.
However, South Korea would go through one most significant economic developments the World has seen, taking it from a country in poverty to one of the top 15 economies in the World today.
