# Project 1: Web-Traffic-Forecasting---Capstone
## DA485

This project looks at the problem of forecasting future values of time-series data. Wikipedia has over 145,000 articles and their view counts available to analyze. Following the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process I was able to develop an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model that showed a prediction of view counts for the following 45 â€“ 60 days. Web forecasting is gaining popularity and has many applications including load balancing for cloud services, and understanding user behavior.
